# Competitive Programming Solutions

This repository contains (sometimes partial) solutions to problems from various
competitive programming websites and competitions. If you need any explanations,
feel free to contact me at bryon.tjanaka@gmail.com. I recognize that as time has
gone on, I have tended to use less and less comments, since the code has gotten
more intuitive for me... :)

Currently, the websites/contests represented in this repo are:
- [UVa Online Judge](https://uva.onlinejudge.org) - `uva` directory
- (more to come once I organize my directories...)
