# Competitive Programming Solutions

This repository contains (sometimes partial) solutions to problems from various
(competitive) programming websites and competitions (not all of them are really
competitions). If you need any explanations, feel free to contact me at
bryon.tjanaka@gmail.com. I recognize that as time has gone on, I have tended to
use less and less comments... :)
