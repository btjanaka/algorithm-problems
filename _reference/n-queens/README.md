# N Queens

Attempts to get n-queens to run _fast_. See `n-queens.cpp` for a more basic
solution to the problem, and see `n-queens-optimized.cpp` for a more optimized
version.

## Usage

As these programs only depend on the standard library, just run:

```bash
g++ <file>.cpp && a.out [N]
```

Where `N` is the size of the board.
